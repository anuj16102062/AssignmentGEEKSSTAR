        <p>
            Web developers work independently as freelancers or with company teams to create websites. Depending on the job, these
            professionals may focus on front-end development, which involves designing sites and producing content, or back-end
            development, which involves writing code to make website features work. Web developers may also become webmasters for a
            site, providing maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting when needed.
